# Virtual Canvas ðŸŽ¨ 
This project is an interactive Hand Gesture Paint Application that utilizes a webcam to track hand gestures for creating drawings on a virtual canvas. It leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for drawing on frames.

## Tech Stack 
- Python
- OpenCV: For real-time video frame processing and drawing.
- MediaPipe: For hand gesture recognition and tracking.
- NumPy: For matrix operations. 

## Features 
- Hand Gesture Detection: Tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Drawing Colors: Choose from four colorsâ€”Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow.
- Clear Canvas: Erase all drawings with a "Clear" button.
- Real-Time Drawing: Draw on the screen by moving your hand.
- Interactive UI: Visual buttons for color selection and clearing the canvas.

## Future Improvements
- Add more colors and brushes.
- Implement an eraser tool for selective clearing.
- Enable saving the drawing to a file.
